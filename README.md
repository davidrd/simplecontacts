simplecontacts
==============

A simple addressbook/contacts API. You need to install Django 1.7 for your operating system.
After installing Django, you can do 
<pre>python manage.py test</pre>
to run the testing suite. You can also do
<pre>python manage.py runserver</pre>
to run the server on your local machine. 
You can currently do POST and GET operations using the API, and the other functionalities are implemented in the backend already.
